# guessing_game

## What it does

Your classic console-based number guessing game! A secret number between 0 and 50 is selected using the [`rand`](https://crates.io/crates/rand) crate and then the user must guess what that number is.

## What it shows

* how to use external crates in a Rust application
* how to take in user input using the standard library's `io` package
* how to handle errors using the `expect()` method
* how to use a `loop` to continuosly repeat the same block of code
